##  Simulations for containing COVID-19 spread 



-----------------------------
**:::Please note I am NOT an expert on infectious disease:::**  
* Code contains citations for
  * R<sub>0</sub> value
  * Probability distribution for symptom onset
  * CDC case numbers 
  * Relevant wikipedia readings 
  
* Basic assumptions
  * The R<sub>0</sub> values for individual cases are normally distributed (should be exponential perhaps?)
  * People are uniformly contagious from when the catch disease until isolation 
  * The cited R<sub>0</sub> value represents a worst-case scenario with no isolation...  
  I assume you can scale this transmission factor by the amount of time prior to isolation  
  
* Figures show
  * The R<sub>0</sub> distribution I'm using for individual cases & the symptom onset distribution I obtained from the literature 
  * Simulations starting with 1k active cases, and simulations starting with 10k cases 


Perhaps getting the number of active cases down to 1k and isolating people quickly (< 24 hrs) after showing symtoms can keep the total case-count low for a year... 
 
Again I am **NOT** an expert on this topic!
